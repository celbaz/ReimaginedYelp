#Yelp Reimagined


Yelp Reimagined is an application I created to  demonstrate how Yelp would run if someone asked me to develop it. I focused on the company's main focus which was restaurant finding. In addition, I added a feature to help users find restaurants.  

##Features
* CRUD for models such as restaurants and reviews
* Backbone JS Front End MVC
* Instagram Oauth Login
* Amazon S3 for user profile pictures
* Utilizes Mapbox API to show locations on maps
* Slide-Out restaurant quick view
* User recommendation option via "Try the Sentence"


##Database
  If you run the command "rake db:seed" it will populate the database with 500 random restaurants in Manhattan, New York. This is thanks to an NYC Open Dataset.

##Improvements

* Pull tagged photos of locations from Instagram
* Map displaying where users have left a review
* More complex recommendation algorithm
* More mobile-friendly map view
